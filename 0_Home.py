st.markdown("""
The sidebar on the left is your main navigation tool.
*   **Home:** You are here! This page provides an overview.
*   **üìÖ Pre-Match Analysis:** Click here to dive into upcoming match predictions and stats.

""")

st.subheader("2. Using the Pre-Match Analysis Page")
st.markdown("""
Once you're on the **üìÖ Pre-Match Analysis** page:
1.  **Select Prediction Week:** Use the first dropdown in the sidebar to choose the week you want to analyze (e.g., "Week 42"). The dashboard will load matches for that week.
2.  **Apply Filters:** Use the subsequent filters in the sidebar to refine the list of matches:
    *   **Filter by Date:** Select a specific date within the chosen week, or leave as "All Dates".
    *   **Country & League:** Narrow down to specific competitions.
    *   **Recommended Bet & Value Bet:** Filter by prediction types.
    *   **Confidence Score Range:** Adjust the slider to see matches within a certain confidence level.
3.  **View Match Overview:** The main area will display a list of matches fitting your criteria, grouped by league. You'll see team names, logos, kick-off times, and key predictions.
4.  **Reset Filters:** If you want to clear all active filters (except the selected week), click the "Reset Filters" button at the top-right of the match overview.
5.  **View Match Details:** For any match in the list, click the **"View Details"** button on the right. This will take you to a dedicated screen with:
    *   In-depth statistical comparisons (team vs. league average).
    *   Head-to-Head (H2H) statistics.
    *   Graphical representations of goal expectancies (Actual vs. Expected).
    *   A full match report (expandable) with various in-game stats.
6.  **Return to Overview:** When in the detail view, click the **"‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to Overview"** button in the sidebar to return to the match list.

st.header("üí° Tips for Best Experience")
st.markdown("""
*   **Allow Data to Load:** After selecting a new week, give the app a moment to load and process the data.
*   **Use Filters Incrementally:** Start with broader filters (like week and country) and then narrow down further.
*   **Check Back Regularly:** Prediction data is updated periodically (e.g., weekly).
